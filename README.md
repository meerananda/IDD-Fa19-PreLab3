## Part 4: Idea Generation

Below are a list of ideas of interactions that can be done using a sensor Each idea is accompanied by a sketch to break it down further.

1. An alarm clock that uses a photoresistor to trigger when the sun rises.
1. A ball that lights up a different color depending on how fast it is thrown, measured using an accelerometer.
1. A night light that uses a photoresistor to track the lighting in the room and activate the light when it gets dark. 
1. An audio mixer controlled by different photoresistors for different inputs.
1. A speaker where the volume control is done using a soft potentiometer.
